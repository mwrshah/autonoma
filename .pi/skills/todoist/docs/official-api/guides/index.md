# Developing with Todoist

**DEPRECATED:** These guides are related to the deprecated Sync API v9 and REST API v2. Please refer to the new unified [Todoist API v1 documentation](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/).

Thanks for your interest in developing apps with Todoist! In this guides section we'll provide an overview of the APIs we offer and cover some common topics for application development using our APIs.

You can use our APIs for free, but depending on your Todoist account plan, some features might be restricted.

If you are looking for reference documentation for our APIs please proceed to either the [REST API Reference](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/) or [Sync API Reference](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/).

Please consider subscribing to the [Todoist API mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/doist.com/g/todoist-api) to get important updates.

## Our APIs

We offer two APIs for external developers, providing different models for sending and receiving data.

#### Rest API

The [Todoist REST API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/) offers the simplest approach to read and write data on the Todoist web service.

For most common application requirements this is our recommended API for external developers and uses an approach that should
be familiar for anyone with experience calling [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs.

We've provided a [Getting Started](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#getting-started) tutorial section within our REST API documentation to introduce you to the API and
some common flows you'll encounter when developing Todoist applications. If you are totally new to our APIs or even unfamiliar with Todoist
this is a great place to start.

#### Sync API

The [Todoist Sync API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/) is used by our web and mobile applications and is recommended for clients that will maintain a
local representation of a user's full account data. It allows for incrementally sending and receiving account data by identifying
positions in an account's state history using a sync token.

This API also contains additional endpoints for areas like account management and less common features that may not yet be implemented
on the newer REST API.

Within the documentation for the Sync API you'll also find a [Getting Started](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#getting-started) tutorial that will
introduce you to using the [Sync](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#sync) endpoint to send and receive data.

## Our SDKs

Our [Python and JavaScript Client SDKs](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#client-sdks) simplify working with Todoist data by reducing the complexity of calling the Todoist APIs.

They are based on the [Todoist REST API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/), are easily installable from the most popular package registries, and you can view examples of their usage in our documentation's examples section.

## Integration Archetypes

You can leverage our APIs in countless ways. In this section, we'll introduce a few typical examples of integrations built on top of our APIs:

- **Easily create tasks in Todoist within your app.** By leveraging our [Quick Add endpoint](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#quick-add-an-item), enable your users to quickly add new tasks to Todoist via our [natural language syntax](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/use-task-quick-add-in-todoist-va4Lhpzz). By automatically appending links to your app to the task content, you can help your users find content within your app faster and return more frequently. _The Quick Add endpoint is the quickest way to get started with Todoist API!_
- **Enrich Todoist tasks in your app.** Are you building an app that helps people organize their life or work? Tap into your users' existing Todoist tasks and enable them to [focus on a single Todoist task at a time](https://www.todoist.com/integrations/apps/minus-app) or [visually organize their day](https://www.todoist.com/integrations/apps/sunsama). To build these scenarios, start by [getting all of your user's active tasks](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#get-active-tasks).
- **Sync Todoist data with your app.** Be it [two-way sync with Outlook](https://www.todoist.com/integrations/apps/tascaly) or building [powerful automation workflows](https://www.todoist.com/integrations/apps/make), our [Sync API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/) is purpose-built for heavy-duty syncing.

## Designing browser extensions

#### Introduction

If you chose to build a browser extension that injects functionality to the Todoist web app, please read through the following guidelines to ensure the best experience for your users.

Browser extensions can integrate into Todoist within the task list and task view.

#### Task view extensions

When adding UIs inside the Task view through a browser extension, consider the following:

- **Browser extensions** live in the **sidebar**,
- Make sure the extension is compatible with the **Mini view of Todoist** (when browser width is reduced to a smaller size, the task view design removes the sidebar and stacks task attributes). Here, your extension should display an icon that represents your extension similar to the task attributes.
- In the **Mini view**, place integrated extensions **above sub-tasks**

![](https://developer.todoist.com/images/content-areas-a216286b.png)

#### Example

As an example, to demonstrate the guidelines above, we designed a mock Timer extension.

- The extension is on the last position within the Task view sidebar.
- The extension’s name is above the extension’s custom UI.
- In the Mini view, the extension uses an icon instead of name to represent its identity.
- In the Mini view, the extension UI is next to the extension icon, following the layout of other Todoist task attributes.

![](https://developer.todoist.com/images/control-apps-e0dfde1a.png)

## Designing UI Extensions

UI Extensions are modules that can be added to an integration to extend the Todoist UI with additional functionality.

Learn more about this in the dedicated [UI Extensions](https://developer.todoist.com/ui-extensions/) section.

# Authorization

In order to make authorized calls to the Todoist REST or Sync APIs, your application must first
obtain an access token.

The following section describes the process for using the [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)
protocol to obtain an access token from the user.

## OAuth

External applications can obtain a user authorized API token via the OAuth2
protocol. Before getting started, developers need to create their applications
in the [App Management Console](https://developer.todoist.com/appconsole.html) and configure a valid OAuth
redirect URL. A registered Todoist application is assigned a unique `Client ID`
and `Client Secret` which are needed for the OAuth2 flow.

This procedure is comprised of 3 steps.

### Step 1: Authorization request

> An example of the URL to the authorization endpoint:

```

https://api.todoist.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=0123456789abcdef&scope=data:read,data:delete&state=secretstring
```

Redirect users to the authorization URL at the endpoint
`https://api.todoist.com/oauth/authorize`, with the specified request parameters.

#### Required parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client\_id _String_ | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| scope _String_ | A comma separated list of permissions that you would like the users to grant to your application. See the below table for detail on the available scopes. |
| state _String_ | A unique and unguessable string. It is used to protect you against cross-site request forgery attacks. |

#### Permission scopes

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| task:add | Grants permission to add new tasks (the application cannot read or modify any existing data). |
| data:read | Grants read-only access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters. |
| data:read\_write | Grants read and write access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters. This scope includes `task:add` and `data:read` scopes. |
| data:delete | Grants permission to delete application data, including tasks, labels, and filters. |
| project:delete | Grants permission to delete projects. |

#### Potential errors

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| User Rejected Authorization Request | When the user denies your authorization request, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=access_denied`. |
| Redirect URI Not Configured | This JSON error will be returned to the requester (your user's browser) if redirect URI is not configured in the App Management Console. |
| Invalid Application Status | When your application exceeds the maximum token limit or when your application is being suspended due to abuse, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_application_status`. |
| Invalid Scope | When the `scope` parameter is invalid, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_scope`. |

### Step 2: Redirection to your application site

When the user grants your authorization request, the user will be redirected to
the redirect URL configured for your application. The redirect request
will come with two query parameters attached: `code` and `state`.

The `code` parameter contains the authorization code that you will use to
exchange for an access token. The `state` parameter should match the `state`
parameter that you supplied in the previous step. If the `state` is unmatched,
your request has been compromised by other parties, and the process should be
aborted.

### Step 3: Token exchange

> An example of exchanging the token:

```

$ curl "https://api.todoist.com/oauth/access_token" \
    -d "client_id=0123456789abcdef" \
    -d "client_secret=secret" \
    -d "code=abcdef" \
    -d "redirect_uri=https://example.com"
```

> On success, Todoist returns HTTP 200 with token in JSON object format:

```

{
  "access_token": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once you have the authorization `code`, you can exchange it for the access token
by sending a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

`https://api.todoist.com/oauth/access_token`.

#### Required parameters

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| client\_id _String_ | The Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| client\_secret _String_ | The Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered. |
| code _String_ | The code that was sent in the query string to the redirect URL in the previous step. |

#### Potential errors

| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bad Authorization Code Error | Occurs when the `code` parameter does not match the code that is given in the redirect request: `{"error": "bad_authorization_code"}` |
| Incorrect Client Credentials Error | Occurs when the `client_id` or `client_secret` parameters are incorrect: `{"error": "incorrect_application_credentials"}` |

# Colors

Some objects (like projects, labels, and filters) returned by our APIs may have colors defined by an
id or name. The table below shows all information you may need for any of these colors.

| ID | Name | Hexadecimal |  | ID | Name | Hexadecimal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 30 | berry\_red | `#B8255F` |  | 40 | light\_blue | `#6988A4` |
| 31 | red | `#DC4C3E` |  | 41 | blue | `#4180FF` |
| 32 | orange | `#C77100` |  | 42 | grape | `#692EC2` |
| 33 | yellow | `#B29104` |  | 43 | violet | `#CA3FEE` |
| 34 | olive\_green | `#949C31` |  | 44 | lavender | `#A4698C` |
| 35 | lime\_green | `#65A33A` |  | 45 | magenta | `#E05095` |
| 36 | green | `#369307` |  | 46 | salmon | `#C9766F` |
| 37 | mint\_green | `#42A393` |  | 47 | charcoal | `#808080` |
| 38 | teal | `#148FAD` |  | 48 | grey | `#999999` |
| 39 | sky\_blue | `#319DC0` |  | 49 | taupe | `#8F7A69` |

# Mobile app URL schemes

Our applications for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-calendar/id572688855) support custom URL schemes for launching to specific views and initiating some common actions.

# Marketing your app

After you complete the work on your Todoist integration, you can choose to submit it for certification.

Please ensure that your submission is associated with a verified Todoist user account.

By submitting your email address as part of your submission, you are granting us permission to contact you as needed regarding the Todoist platform and anything that may affect the operation of your integration.

If your app passes the certification process, we will create a dedicated page on our [Integrations Pages](https://www.todoist.com/integrations) to showcase your work,
and help with marketing the integration.

Certifying your integration means:

1. [Creating a submission](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#creating-a-submission)
2. [Passing certification](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#passing-certification)
3. [Getting published](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#getting-published)
4. [After publishing](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#after-publishing)

Submitting your app for certification is **optional** and primarily serves to give your integration more visibility. Certification is not required to develop with the Todoist APIs and share the resulting integration with users.

## Creating a submission

First, fill out the [app submissions form](https://developer.todoist.com/submissions.html). Just add a marketing description, installation
instructions, and links to your website and privacy policy.

We'll also ask you for some images, in the following format:

- Your app icon, in JPG format on a white background. The size of the image should be 250x250px.
- One or more screenshots in JPG format at 1600x1000px. If your screenshot includes images of Todoist, it
should use the default theme (Red).

## Passing certification

After you've submitted your app, we'll email you a confirmation. We aim to review submissions and respond with any
feedback within ten business days.

#### Certification process

The certification is composed of:

1. **Submission review** \- Ensuring that the data you submitted to the form will create a solid integration page. You can expect feedback on the details of your submission, such as the length of the texts you submitted, or opportunities to improve the screenshots.
2. **Technical review** \- We will review your demo video and, if necessary, manually test the integration to see if it works as described and that there are no critical bugs that prevent users from having a good user experience.
3. **Marketing review** \- Even though our [Integration Pages](https://www.todoist.com/integrations) represent the work of our partners, we still aim to present integrations consistently and might give feedback on, for example, the voice of descriptions. We will suggest concrete changes to make the process easier for you wherever possible.

If we find any issues along the way, we'll be in touch via email and work with you to resolve them.
If you have any questions or updates at any time, you can reply to any of the emails you've received during
the submissions process. We'll aim to get back to you within two business days.

#### Certification requirements

Below is a list we frequently focus on during review. Note that meeting the below criteria is does not guarantee passing the certification but is broadly representative of the criteria we look at.

- All the fields in the submission form are filled out in English.
- Your app complements or enhances the functionality of Todoist. It should not replicate functionality already included.
- Your app is free of any functional errors during our testing.
- Your app integrates with Todoist directly. We do not host listings for services that integrate solely via 3rd party automation providers like IFTTT and Zapier, or integrations that rely solely on our [email forwarding](https://www.todoist.com/help/articles/forward-emails-to-todoist-JPJ1V339) feature.
- Users can easily set up the integration using the instructions you've provided.
- All links provided are HTTPS enabled to ensure the security of our users. If you're submitting a native platform app, it must be signed with a trusted certificate.
- Any use of the Todoist name or logo follows our [brand guidelines](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#brand-usage).
- Your privacy policy ensures you will not sell or share our users' data with any third parties without their consent.
- The marketing descriptions and images you've provided are clear, follow our style and the guidelines in the integration submission form.

## Getting published

Once your submission has passed our review, we'll publish your listing and provide you with a public link that you
can share! We'll also translate your listing to expand your marketing reach where it makes sense for your app.

## After publishing

After we publish your integration page, please do reach out to us in the following cases:

- You update your integration after launch. We will highlight the update with an _Updated_ tag.
- Interest in more comprehensive marketing collaboration.

If you have any further questions or updates to provide after we've published your integration page, you can always reach out to our app submissions team at https://www.todoist.com/contact/login?returnTo=%2Fcontact by selecting the following categories (in order of appearance): `Something else` → `Integrations Development`.

We're happy to help!

# Brand usage

Thanks for using Todoist's APIs to build an application!

If you plan to utilize Todoist's logo or branding in the visual design
of your application or website, please adhere to
[Todoist's brand guidelines](https://doist.com/brand-assets/todoist-logo.zip).

In addition, please take note of the following:

- "Todoist" should not be the first word in your application's name. It
may be used elsewhere in the name, though. For instance "x for
Todoist" or "x with Todoist", etc. This makes it clear that your
application is created by you and not by Doist.
- You must clearly state that your application is "not created by,
affiliated with, or supported by Doist" in your application
description.

By using the Todoist marks you agree to properly follow the above
brand guidelines as well as
our [Terms of Service](https://doist.com/terms-of-service). For further
information about the use of the Todoist brand, please contact
[press@doist.com](mailto:press@doist.com).
