# Pre-Push Preparation and Push

Run formatters, linters, and type checkers on all changed files, then commit and push.

## Step 1: Identify changed files

Run `git diff --name-only` and `git diff --staged --name-only` to get all changed files (staged and unstaged). Categorize them:
- **Frontend files**: anything under `klair-client/`
- **Backend files**: anything under `klair-api/`
- If no files are changed, inform the user and stop.

## Step 2: Commit real work first

Before running any formatters or linters, commit the actual code changes so they are safely preserved and isolated from any formatter/linter modifications.

- Run `git diff` (unstaged) and `git diff --staged` (staged) to understand what the changes are about.
- Also run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commit message style.
- Stage only the specific changed files by name (NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`)
- If user provided a commit message via arguments, use it. Otherwise, analyze the diff output and draft a concise descriptive commit message that reflects the "why" of the changes.
- Commit using HEREDOC format with Co-Authored-By trailer.

## Step 3: Lint changed files

Lint BEFORE formatting so that any lint fixes get cleaned up by the formatter afterwards.

- **Frontend**: from `klair-client/`, run `npx eslint --max-warnings 0 --no-warn-ignored <files>` on the changed frontend files
- **Backend**: from `klair-api/`, run `uv run ruff check <files>` on the changed backend files
- If lint fails, fix the issues and re-run. Do NOT proceed until lint passes clean.
- If lint fixes produced file changes, stage and commit as a separate commit with message "Fix lint issues".

## Step 4: Format changed files

Run formatters LAST so they catch everything including any lint fixes. Run on ONLY the files that were changed in Step 1 (not the entire codebase).

- **Frontend** (`klair-client/`): from the `klair-client/` directory, run `npx prettier --write <files>` on the changed frontend files
- **Backend** (`klair-api/`): from the `klair-api/` directory, run `uv run ruff format <files>` on the changed backend files
- Run `git diff --stat` to check if the formatter produced any changes.
- If it did, stage those files and commit as a separate commit with message "Run formatters on changed files".
- If no changes, skip this commit.

## Step 5: Type check (scoped to changed files only)

Only typecheck the files that were actually changed. Do NOT fix pre-existing type errors in untouched files.

- **Backend**: from `klair-api/`, run `uv run pyright <changed-backend-files>` passing only the specific changed `.py` files as arguments. Pyright supports file-level checking.
- **Frontend**: `tsc` cannot check individual files with tsconfig, so run `pnpm tsc --noEmit 2>&1` and filter the output to only show errors in the changed frontend files. Use grep to match only lines containing the changed file paths. If the only errors are in files you didn't touch, ignore them and proceed.
- Only run the type checker for the side (frontend/backend) that has changes.
- If type check fails ON CHANGED FILES, fix those issues and re-run. Do NOT fix errors in files you didn't change. Do NOT proceed until changed files pass clean.

## Step 6: Handle branch divergence

Before pushing, check if local and remote have diverged:
```
git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/<branch>
```
- If remote has commits that local doesn't, run `git pull --rebase origin <branch>` before pushing.
- If rebase produces conflicts, stop and inform the user.

## Step 7: Push

Run `git push origin <branch>` where `<branch>` is the current branch.

## User-provided commit message

(See the user's input above in the skill invocation.)

## Important rules

- NEVER run `npm run format` (creates massive diffs across entire codebase) -- only run prettier on the specific changed files
- NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- NEVER force push
- NEVER skip pre-commit hooks
- If formatter changes are on top of already-committed work, commit formatting as a SEPARATE commit
- Run frontend and backend tools in parallel where possible (e.g., formatting both sides simultaneously)
