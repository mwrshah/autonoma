# Spec: Multi-Pi Orchestration — From Single Pi to Concurrent Per-Workstream Agents

## Problem

The runtime creates a single Pi agent session at startup (`runtime.ts:128`). All messages — regardless of workstream — are serialized through one turn queue into one session. This means:

- **No concurrency**: A long-running orchestrator turn for workstream A blocks messages for workstream B and non-work queries.
- **Context pollution**: The single session accumulates context from all workstreams, leading to confusion and faster context exhaustion.
- **No role separation**: The single session uses the orchestrator prompt but also handles Todoist, general queries, and session management — roles that should belong to a dedicated default agent.
- **Workstream lifecycle is incomplete**: `close_workstream` ends the single Pi session, which is catastrophic since it's the only one.

The Pi lifecycle spec (01) built the foundations — session linkage, state machine, soft-delete, close tool. This spec builds the multi-Pi architecture on top of those foundations.

## Approach

### Two agent types, distinct lifecycles

- **Default agent**: Always-on, long-lived. Handles non-workstream messages, Todoist, general queries, session management commands. Created at startup, persists until shutdown. Uses `DEFAULT_AGENT_PROMPT`.
- **Orchestrator agents**: Ephemeral, one per active workstream. Created on demand when the router creates or reopens a workstream. Destroyed when `close_workstream` is called or the runtime detects a crash. Uses `buildOrchestratorPrompt(ctx)`.

### PiSessionManager as the registry

A new `PiSessionManager` class owns the lifecycle of all Pi sessions. The runtime delegates to it instead of holding `this.piSession` directly. The manager maintains:

- One default agent session (keyed `"default"`)
- Zero or more orchestrator sessions (keyed by workstream ID)
- A per-session `TurnQueue` for each active session

Sessions run concurrently — each has its own queue that serializes turns within that session, but different sessions process turns in parallel.

### Message routing after classification

The router classifies as before. The runtime then dispatches to the correct session:

| Classification result | Target session |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `action: "matched"` + open workstream has active orchestrator | That orchestrator |
| `action: "matched"` + open workstream, no orchestrator | Spawn orchestrator, route to it |
| `action: "created"` | Spawn new orchestrator, route to it |
| `action: "reopened"` | Spawn new orchestrator for reopened workstream, route to it |
| `isWorkMessage: false` or no workstream | Default agent |

Hook events (Stop/SessionEnd) look up `pi_session_id` from the CC session record and route to the owning Pi's queue.

Cron ticks always route to the default agent.

### Context transfer on orchestrator creation

When the router creates a new workstream, the user has been conversing with the default agent. The new orchestrator needs that conversational context. Since the SDK's `createAgentSession()` does not support initial messages, context transfer happens via a **first-prompt context injection**:

1. Extract the default agent's last 20 messages in `"input"` mode (surfaced only — user + final assistant text per turn, no tools/system). That's roughly 10 user/assistant couplets.
2. Strip transport prefixes (`[Web] User:`, `[WhatsApp] User:`, quote wrapping) — these are mirroring labels, not meaningful to an orchestrator. Keep only raw user text and raw assistant text.
3. Format with the current user message at top and bottom, prior context in XML tags in the middle:
   ```
   [Workstream: "fix-auth-bug" (abc12345)] [NEW]
   ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug

   <prior_context>
   User: can you check my pending tasks
   Assistant: Here are 5 pending tasks: ...
   User: ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug
   </prior_context>

   [Workstream: "fix-auth-bug" (abc12345)] [NEW]
   ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug
   ```
4. The current message appears three times by design: as the outer prompt (top and bottom, with workstream prefix) and as the last entry in `<prior_context>` (showing its place in the conversation flow). The workstream prefix stays on the outer message but NOT in the `<prior_context>` entries.

This requires no SDK changes. The runtime already formats message prefixes; a context-transfer block is a natural extension.

### Classification improvements

The Gemini classification prompt needs additional rules to prevent workstream creation for meta-operations:

- Session management commands ("kill tmux", "close sessions", "check status") → `is_work_message: false`
- Cron health-check messages → `is_work_message: false`
- Workstreams are about repository-scoped work, not infrastructure meta-operations

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: PiSessionManager — session registry and lifecycle

**New module** — `src/control-surface/pi/session-manager.ts`

The `PiSessionManager` manages all Pi agent sessions. It replaces the runtime's direct `this.piSession` reference.

```typescript
interface ManagedPiSession {
  session: AgentSession;
  queue: TurnQueue;
  role: "default" | "orchestrator";
  workstreamId: string | null; // null for default
  piSessionId: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

interface PiSessionManager {
  getDefault(): ManagedPiSession;
  getByWorkstream(workstreamId: string): ManagedPiSession | undefined;
  getByPiSessionId(piSessionId: string): ManagedPiSession | undefined;
  listOrchestrators(): ManagedPiSession[];

  createDefault(config, customTools): Promise<ManagedPiSession>;
  createOrchestrator(workstreamId, workstreamName, repoPath?, customTools?): Promise<ManagedPiSession>;
  destroyOrchestrator(workstreamId: string, reason: string): void;

  disposeAll(): void;
}
```

**Design decisions**:
- The default session is created at startup and is always available. `getDefault()` never returns undefined after initialization.
- Orchestrator sessions are created lazily — only when a message first routes to a workstream that doesn't have one.
- Each `ManagedPiSession` owns its own `TurnQueue`. The queue serializes turns within that session. Different sessions' queues run concurrently.
- The runtime's `enqueue()` method routes to the correct session's queue rather than a global queue.
- `destroyOrchestrator()` calls `session.dispose()`, stops the queue, updates the blackboard row to `ended`, and removes from the map.

**Blackboard integration**:
- Each orchestrator gets its own `pi_sessions` row with `role='orchestrator'` and a reference to the workstream
- The default agent gets a `pi_sessions` row with `role='default'`
- `reconcilePreviousPiSessions` at startup should reconcile both roles

### FR-2: Per-session turn queues with concurrent execution

**Replace the single global queue** with per-session queues.

- The existing `TurnQueue` class is reused as-is — one instance per `ManagedPiSession`.
- The runtime's `enqueue()` becomes a routing function: classify → pick target session → enqueue to that session's queue.
- Queue lifecycle callbacks (`onItemStart`, `onItemEnd`, `onDepthChange`) should include the session identity so the WebSocket hub and session state can attribute events correctly.
- The `PiSessionState` (observability) either becomes per-session or is extended to track multiple sessions. The `/status` endpoint should report all active sessions.

**Concurrency model**: Each queue independently pumps. If workstream A's orchestrator is mid-turn, workstream B's orchestrator and the default agent can still process their queues. This is the primary user-facing improvement.

### FR-3: Message routing — dispatch to correct Pi session

**Update `handleWebSocketMessage()`** and the WhatsApp inbound handler:

After classification:
1. Determine target session using the routing table from the Approach section
2. If the target is an orchestrator that doesn't exist yet, create it via `PiSessionManager.createOrchestrator()`
3. Enqueue to the target session's queue

**Update `handleHook()`**:

For Stop events:
1. Look up the CC session's `pi_session_id` from the blackboard
2. Find the owning Pi session via `PiSessionManager.getByPiSessionId()`
3. Enqueue the hook message to that Pi's queue
4. If no owning Pi is found (session predates multi-Pi, or orchestrator was destroyed), fall back to the default agent

For SessionStart/SessionEnd (bookkeeping only, not forwarded to Pi): no routing change needed — they write to SQLite directly.

### FR-4: Context transfer on orchestrator creation

When `PiSessionManager.createOrchestrator()` is called because the router created or reopened a workstream:

1. Read the default agent's last 20 messages via `readPiHistoryFromMessages(sessionId, sessionFile, session.messages, "input")`. The `"input"` mode returns surfaced-only items: user messages + final assistant text per turn, no tools or system messages. 20 messages ≈ 10 user/assistant couplets.
2. Strip transport prefixes from context entries — remove `[Web] User: "..."`, `[WhatsApp] User: "..."` wrapping and workstream prefixes (`[Workstream: ...]`). These are runtime transport labels for WhatsApp mirroring; the orchestrator needs only raw conversational text.
3. Format the first prompt with the current message at top and bottom, prior context in XML tags:
   ```
   [Workstream: "fix-auth-bug" (abc12345)] [NEW]
   ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug

   <prior_context>
   User: can you check my pending tasks
   Assistant: Here are 5 pending tasks: ...
   User: ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug
   </prior_context>

   [Workstream: "fix-auth-bug" (abc12345)] [NEW]
   ok for project autonoma please fix the auth bug
   ```
4. This formatted text becomes the first prompt to the new orchestrator session.

**Intentional repetition**: The current user message appears three times — as the outer prompt (top and bottom, with workstream prefix) and as the last entry in `<prior_context>` (showing its position in the conversation flow). This is by design: the outer message is the actionable prompt; the context block shows the conversational thread that led to it.

**Context window**: Flat count of 20 messages from the default agent's `session.messages`. No time window, no token budget. If the default session has fewer than 20 messages, use all of them.

### FR-5: Default agent role changes

**Remove `close_workstream` tool** from the default agent. Only orchestrators have it (already gated by `role === "orchestrator"` in `createCustomTools()`).

**Add workstream awareness** to the default agent prompt:
- The default agent should know that active workstreams have dedicated orchestrators
- When user asks about a workstream that has an active orchestrator, the default agent should redirect: "That workstream has a dedicated orchestrator handling it. I'll route your message there."
- The default agent can query the blackboard to see active Pi sessions and their workstream assignments

**Update `DEFAULT_AGENT_PROMPT`** to include:
- Awareness that orchestrator agents exist per-workstream
- Instruction to not attempt work that belongs to an active orchestrator
- Retained scope: Todoist, general questions, session management commands, non-work messages

### FR-6: Orchestrator lifecycle

**Creation triggers**:
- Router `action: "created"` — new workstream
- Router `action: "reopened"` — reopened workstream
- Router `action: "matched"` but no active orchestrator — lazy creation for workstreams that lost their orchestrator (crash recovery)

**Creation steps**:
1. Call `createAutonomaAgent()` with `role: "orchestrator"`, `orchestratorContext: { workstreamName, workstreamId, repoPath }`
2. Upsert `pi_sessions` row with `role='orchestrator'`, linked to the workstream
3. Subscribe to session events (streaming, tool use, etc.)
4. Create a `TurnQueue` for the session
5. Register in `PiSessionManager`

**Destruction triggers**:
- `close_workstream` tool execution — the tool already sets Pi session to `ended`
- Runtime detects orchestrator crash (uncaught error in queue processing)
- Runtime shutdown — `disposeAll()`

**Destruction steps**:
1. Stop the orchestrator's turn queue
2. Unsubscribe from session events
3. Call `session.dispose()`
4. Update `pi_sessions` row to `ended` or `crashed`
5. Remove from `PiSessionManager`

**Session storage**: Each orchestrator's session JSONL lives in its own file under `~/.autonoma/control-surface/sessions/`. The SDK's `SessionManager.create(cwd, sessionsDir)` handles file naming. Different orchestrators get different session files automatically since each `createAgentSession` call creates a new session.

### FR-7: Gemini classification improvements

**Update the classification prompt** in `buildClassificationPrompt()`:

Add rules:
```
8. Session management commands (kill tmux, close sessions, check status, restart daemon) are NOT work — set is_work_message to false.
9. Cron health-check messages are NOT work — set is_work_message to false.
10. Workstreams are about repository-scoped coding/engineering work, not meta-operations on the Autonoma system itself.
```

These rules prevent the router from creating workstreams for infrastructure commands that should go to the default agent.

### FR-8: Status and observability updates

**Update `/status` endpoint** to report all active Pi sessions:
```typescript
{
  pi: {
    default: { sessionId, messageCount, busy, queueDepth },
    orchestrators: [
      { sessionId, workstreamId, workstreamName, messageCount, busy, queueDepth },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

**Update WebSocket events** to include session identity:
- `queue_item_start`, `queue_item_end` should include `piSessionId` and `workstreamId`
- `pi_surfaced` should include `workstreamId` so the web client can attribute responses

**Auto-surface routing**: Each session's final assistant text is still surfaced to WhatsApp and web. For orchestrators, the surfaced message should include a workstream label so the user knows which orchestrator is speaking.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. At startup, the runtime creates a default agent (role `"default"`) and zero orchestrators
2. When the router creates a new workstream, an orchestrator Pi session is spawned and the message routes to it
3. The new orchestrator receives the recent default-agent conversation as context in its first prompt
4. Messages classified to an existing workstream with an active orchestrator route to that orchestrator's queue
5. Non-work messages and messages with no workstream route to the default agent
6. Hook Stop events route to the Pi session that owns the CC session (via `pi_session_id` lookup)
7. Cron ticks route to the default agent only
8. Each Pi session has its own turn queue; turns within a session are serialized, but different sessions run concurrently
9. `close_workstream` destroys the orchestrator session and removes it from the registry
10. The default agent does not have `close_workstream` tool
11. Session management commands ("kill tmux", "check status") do not create workstreams
12. `/status` endpoint reports all active Pi sessions (default + orchestrators)
13. Surfaced messages include workstream attribution so the user knows which agent is responding
